# Udacity DLND-Language-Translation

### Introduction
---
In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

### Getting the project files
---
The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the language-translation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.
Translates English Language to French Language

### Project Description
---
This project, will peek a realm of neural network machine translation. The model here will
learn how to translate from one language to another.
A sequence to sequence model will be trained on a dataset of English and French sentences
that can translate new sentences from English to French.
